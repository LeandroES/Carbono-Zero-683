# Carbono Zero 683: Intelligent System for CO2 Measurement and Management

**Carbono Zero 683** is a comprehensive real-time environmental monitoring system designed to measure CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity in classrooms and offices. The project aims not only to assess air quality but also to estimate the carbon tax per person to promote awareness regarding environmental impact.

This project was developed as a Final Project Proposal for the Software Engineering program at Universidad La Salle - Arequipa.

## Project Description

The system integrates data acquisition via specialized sensors, storage within a NoSQL database, and visualization through an interactive dashboard.

**Key Functionalities:**
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Acquisition of CO2 levels, temperature, and relative humidity.
* **Emission Calculation:** Estimation of CO2 emissions generated by human occupancy (expressed in grams and kilograms).
* **Carbon Tax:** Automatic calculation of the carbon tax per person based on international rates to incentivize sustainability.
* **Alerts and Analytics:** Historical and real-time dashboards to facilitate decision-making (e.g., ventilation improvement).

## Objectives and SDGs

The project aligns with the **2030 Agenda**, focusing on the fulfillment of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
* **SDG 3:** Good Health and Well-being.
* **SDG 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities.
* **SDG 13:** Climate Action.

## Architecture and Technologies

The system is divided into three main components:

### 1. Frontend (Visualization)
Developed using **React** and **Vite** to ensure a fast and interactive user experience.
* **Key libraries:** `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` for environmental data charting, and `axios` for API consumption.

### 2. Backend (API and Logic)
Built with **FastAPI (Python)**, responsible for session management, WebSockets for live data transmission, and hardware communication.
* **Key libraries:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `beanie` (ODM for MongoDB), `motor`, `pyserial` (sensor reading), and `websockets`.

### 3. Database
* **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Optimized for the efficient handling of sensor time-series data.

## Required Hardware

The physical system consists of the following components:
* **Sensors:** 2x Sensirion SCD30 (CO2, Temperature, Humidity).
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Mega 2560 R3 (Data acquisition via I2C).
* **Central Processing:** Raspberry Pi 5 (Server and Database).
* **Storage:** NVMe Base HAT+ with NVMe SSD.

## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js & npm
* MongoDB (local or Atlas)
* Arduino IDE (to upload the `.ino` script)

### 1. Hardware Configuration
1. Connect the SCD30 sensors to the Arduino Mega via I2C.
2. Upload the script `carbono-zero-backend/hardware/sensors/scd30x2.ino` to the Arduino.
3. Connect the Arduino via USB to the host machine (Raspberry Pi or PC).

### 2. Backend Configuration
```bash
cd carbono-zero-backend

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
# Create a .env file based on the required configuration (MongoDB URL, Serial Port, etc.)

# Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
